# What is TritonVR?

Battle your friends in the first publicly available shared-space multiplayer FPS built exclusively for the Quest, where you need to move in real life to move in the game! No complex setup required - all you need is a friend and a thirst for battle!

Duck, jump, slide, crouch, and lean to gain the upper hand with unparalleled 6DOF movement.  Wage war against your friends in the same room at the same time on a diverse set of maps! Use a vast range of weapons, ranging from swords and shields to rifles and pistols (and everything else in-between) to destroy your opponents in intense, visceral close-quarters combat.
